Enhance provider creation with the addition of handleLogin function, improved error handling, change of IAuthResponse to IValidationResponse, and a new return type for the validation function.


### Added
- **handleLogin Function**: Implemented a dedicated method for user authentication that supports a configurable `validationFunction` for both synchronous and asynchronous validation processes. This function also handles persisting the authenticated user to the session.
- **handleAuthError Function**: Enhanced error handling by providing structured responses for authentication errors, ensuring that the user receives clear and informative feedback during the authentication process.
Hereâ€™s the updated changeset entry reflecting the renaming:

### Changed
- **handleAuthError Function**: Enhanced error handling to deliver clearer and more context-specific responses during the authentication process, improving user feedback.
- **Response Interface**: Renamed `IAuthResponse` to `IValidationResponse` to better reflect its purpose and improve clarity regarding validation outcomes.
- **Validation Function Return Type**: Established a specific return type for the validation function, enhancing type safety and ensuring consistency across all authentication providers.
- **Redirect Functions**: Renamed `onLoginSuccess` to `successRedirect` and `onLoginFailure` to `failureRedirect` for improved clarity in handling redirect behavior after authentication outcomes.
